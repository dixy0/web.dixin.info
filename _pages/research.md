# 1. Brain functional connectivity in different task conditions
======
This line of research focuses on understanding of brain connectivity and network organizations in different task conditions.

# 2. Method developments for studying task related connectivity
======
Method developments on methods for studying task related connectivity, including psychophysiological interaction (PPI), beta series, sliding window, and intersubject correlation methods on both conventional task data and naturalistic task data.

# 3. Brain functional connectivity modulated by other regions
This line of researches focuses on how brain connectivity between two brain regions is modulated by a third region.


## 4. Brain metabolic connectivity and networks
This line of research focuses on brain metabolic connectivity as measured by FDG-PET.
