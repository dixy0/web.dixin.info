In spirit of open science, I am trying to make my research outputs openly available. But it takes time and efforts. I will put some of the data, codes, and statistical maps and matrices on this page. 

## Codes
MATLAB codes for intersubject correlation analysis of dynamic connectivity

MATLAB codes for intersubject correlation analysis of dynamic connectivity in movie watching data. code statistical maps

MATLAB codes for PPI and beta series analysis

MATLAB codes for psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis and beta series analysis in our task connectomics paper published in Cerebral Cortex. link

MATLAB simulation codes for PPI correlations

The codes for simulation of the correlations of PPI (psychophysiological interaction) between two different ways of calculations, and the codes for calculating coefficient of variation using Bland and Altman’s method (Bland and Altman, 1996). link

## Network matrices
Coactivation network vs. resting-state network

This dataset includes a coactivation matrix of 140 regions of interest calculated from Neurosynth database and a correlation matrix of resting-state functional connectivity. link

## Regions of interest
Symmetrical ROIs using spherical packing algorithm

This is a set of symmetrical regions of interest (ROIs) defined using spherical packing algorithm. These ROIs were used to calculated functional connectivity lateralization in our paper. link

## Spatial maps
ICA maps for FDG-PET images

These maps were used in our study on interregional causal influences in aging. link.

ICA maps for gray matter and white matter volume images

These maps were used in our study on sex differences of brain structural alterations in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). link. 

Reference: Di X, Biswal BB (2016). Similarly expanded bilateral temporal lobe volumes in female and male children with autism spectrum disorder. Biological Psychiatry: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging 1(2):178-185.

Six ICA maps of the default mode network (DMN) and task positive networks

These six ICA (independent component analysis) maps were used in our paper titled "Modulatory interactions between the default mode network and task positive networks in resting-state". link 

Reference: Di X, Biswal BB (2014). Modulatory Interactions between the Default Mode Network and Task Positive Networks in Resting-State. PeerJ 2:e367.

Nine major resting-state networks

These nine ICA maps were used in out paper titled "Dynamic brain functional connectivity modulated by resting-state networks". link
