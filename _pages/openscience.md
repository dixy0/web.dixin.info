In spirit of open science, I am trying to make my research outputs openly available. But it takes time and efforts. I will put some of the data, codes, and statistical maps and matrices on this page. 

## Codes
MATLAB codes for intersubject correlation analysis of dynamic connectivity

MATLAB codes for intersubject correlation analysis of dynamic connectivity in movie watching data. code statistical maps

MATLAB codes for PPI and beta series analysis

MATLAB codes for psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis and beta series analysis in our task connectomics paper published in Cerebral Cortex. link

MATLAB simulation codes for PPI correlations

The codes for simulation of the correlations of PPI (psychophysiological interaction) between two different ways of calculations, and the codes for calculating coefficient of variation using Bland and Altman’s method (Bland and Altman, 1996). link

## ICA maps
#### ICA maps from FDG-PET images
ICA [maps](https://osf.io/4a3vt/) generated from FDG-PET images from [ADNI](http://adni.loni.usc.edu/) ([Di et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.24728)). 

#### ICA maps from brain volumetric images
ICA [maps](https://neurovault.org/collections/973/) generated from gray matter and white matter volumetric images from [ABIDE](http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/) ([Di & Biswal, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsc.2015.11.006)).

#### ICA maps from fMRI images
Six ICA [maps](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1402207.v1) of the default mode network (DMN) and task positive networks ([Di & Biswal, 2014](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.367)). 

ICA [maps](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1402240.v1) of nine major resting-state networks ([Di & Biswal, 2015](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00429-013-0634-3))

## Network matrices
Coactivation network vs. resting-state network

This dataset includes a coactivation matrix of 140 regions of interest calculated from Neurosynth database and a correlation matrix of resting-state functional connectivity. link 

Reference: Di X, Gohel S, Kim EH and Biswal BB (2013). Task vs. Rest - Different Network Configurations between the Coactivation and the Resting-State Brain Networks. Front Hum Neurosci 7:493. 

## Regions of interest
Symmetrical ROIs using spherical packing algorithm

This is a set of symmetrical regions of interest (ROIs) defined using spherical packing algorithm. These ROIs were used to calculated functional connectivity lateralization in our paper. link
