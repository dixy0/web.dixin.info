In spirit of open science, I am trying to make my research outputs openly available. But it takes time and efforts. I will put some of the data, codes, and statistical maps and matrices on this page. 

## Codes
MATLAB codes for intersubject correlation analysis of dynamic connectivity

MATLAB codes for intersubject correlation analysis of dynamic connectivity in movie watching data. code statistical maps

MATLAB codes for PPI and beta series analysis

MATLAB codes for psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis and beta series analysis in our task connectomics paper published in Cerebral Cortex. link

MATLAB simulation codes for PPI correlations

The codes for simulation of the correlations of PPI (psychophysiological interaction) between two different ways of calculations, and the codes for calculating coefficient of variation using Bland and Altman’s method (Bland and Altman, 1996). link

## ICA maps
### ICA maps from FDG-PET images
ICA [maps](https://osf.io/4a3vt/) generated from FDG-PET images from [ADNI](http://adni.loni.usc.edu/) ([Di et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.24728)). 

### ICA maps from brain volumetric images
ICA [maps](https://neurovault.org/collections/973/) generated from gray matter and white matter volumetric images from [ABIDE](http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/) ([Di & Biswal, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsc.2015.11.006)).

### ICA maps from fMRI images
Six ICA [maps](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1402207.v1) of the default mode network (DMN) and task positive networks ([Di & Biswal, 2014](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.367)). 

ICA [maps](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1402240.v1) of nine major resting-state networks ([Di & Biswal, 2015](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00429-013-0634-3))

## Brain connectivity matrices
Task vs. Rest: Brain network [matrices](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3856098.v2) derived from coactivations and resting-state connectivity ([Di et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00493)). 

## Regions of interest
Symmetrical [ROIs](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.951970.v2) using spherical packing algorithm ([Di et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.1089/brain.2013.0215)).
