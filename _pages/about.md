My name is 邸新. My given name, 新 (Xin), means **new** in Chinese. 

My research interest is mainly on understanding brain connectivity and brain network organizations using brain imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Click [here](https://web.dixin.info/research/) for details about my research.

For more information, see my CV.
